## Foreword

This is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

*Fillit is a project that lets you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing.

*A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.*
